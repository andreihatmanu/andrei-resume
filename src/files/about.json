Studying, I managed to fulfill my personal interest in the IT world and, meanwhile, I developed my programming and OOP skills.\n\nI am a cooperating person, willing to achieve personal and professional success as best as possible. I consider myself logical, strategic and determined to take part in as many challenges as possible. This is why I love working with new projects, people, personalities and technologies that I have never practiced.\nThe current company has offered me the opportunity to get involved in new technologies, so that I can bring as much value to the company and to the projects regardless of personal or professional qualities and abilities.\n\nMy personal intereses are in JavaScript frameworks and libraries; backend based on Javascript; web development and code optimization and progressive web application.\n\nI am ready for new challenges!
